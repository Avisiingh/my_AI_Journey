👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Avinash Kumar, a mathematics undergraduate and Data Science learner.
I’m passionate about Machine Learning and AI, and I use this repo to track my growth — from learning fundamentals to building real-world projects. Each notebook and reflection captures where I started and how I’m improving step by step.

🎯 Goals

- Stay consistent with daily learning
- Build strong ML/DL foundations
